# MudletConsiderRanks
On Lusternia (and other IRE MUDs), using the CONSIDER command on a NPC supplies a phrase that indicates the strength of the NPC. This Mudlet package will append a rank number to the phrases. So the phrases will continue to be displayed but the number means you won't have to check the help file every time you forget whether "not to be trifled with" is stronger than "quite powerful." Always remember that CONSIDER measures absolute might, not might relative to your character.

The package will add a set of triggers for the phrases and an alias for the CONSIDER and PROBE commands. The triggers are deactivated most of the time so they won't trigger during conversation. The alias won't affect what you type, it merely activates the trigger group and sets a tempTimer to deactivate the triggers after a short time. Because of the timer, this package's features might not work during instances of extreme lag.
